I developed a Chess GUI in .NET using WPF, creating an interactive and visually appealing interface for players. The application features a fully functional chessboard where users can make moves, and it includes move validation, turn-based play, and highlighting of valid moves. The design leverages WPFâ€™s data-binding and UI capabilities to ensure a smooth, responsive experience. This project enhanced my understanding of event-driven programming and advanced UI design in WPF.
