The hospital management system I developed in Java using OOP principles provides a streamlined approach to managing hospital operations. The program features classes for patients, doctors, and administrative staff, each with specific attributes and methods. Patients can book appointments, view their medical history, and receive billing information, while doctors can manage patient records and schedules. The system also incorporates inheritance for specialized doctor types and polymorphism to handle various appointment procedures. The application ensures efficient management, enhances data accessibility, and is designed for scalability to accommodate additional features as needed.
